Find two largest elements in a sequence using MPI 
This C program demonstrates parallel computing using MPI (Message Passing Interface) to find the largest and second-largest values in an array. It is designed to run with exactly four MPI processes. The program distributes parts of the array across the processes, computes partial maximum values, and aggregates these to find the global maximum and second-largest values.
